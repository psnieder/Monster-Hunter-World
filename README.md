# Monster-Hunter-World
Damage Calculator for Monster Hunter World <br>
Still very incomplete <br>
  - Missing data for the following monsters: <br>
    - Legiana, Jyuratodus, Lavasioth, Nergigante, Kirin, Kushala Daora, Teostra, Vaal Hazak, Xeno'jiva, Deviljho, and Kulve Taroth <br>
  - Only the Bow and Greatsword weapons have their move set/motion values complete <br>
  - _Test class as you can see is just that.  Most of the stuff commented out was me just messing around for a little while, but it will give you output if you run it for a monster other than the ones listed above with either the Bow or Greatsword as a weapon
